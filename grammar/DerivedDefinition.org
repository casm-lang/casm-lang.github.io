* DerivedDefinition

A =derived= definition enables to specify derived functions 
which are identified by its =Identifier= name. 
If a derived has parameters, the function signature has to be fully typed. 
By default a derived =Term= is side-effect free in the sense that it does
not produce any updates to modify the ASM in any way.
Additionally a derived function can be attributed by =pure= to indicate
that the result of the defined =Term= can be statically computed at compile-time.
