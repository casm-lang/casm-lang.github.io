* FunctionDefinition

A =function= definition enables the creation of global ASM state functions with a defined type relation. Additionally every function initial state can be specified through =MaybeInitially=.
Furthermore, due to the fact that ASM functions are by default =undef= (undefined) over the whole value domain, the =MaybeDefined= optionally enables the definition of a defined default value.
