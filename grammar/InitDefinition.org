* InitDefinition

An =init= definition is used to specify and control the initialization phase of the ASM agents during a run of an CASM specification. 
The possible initialization variants are:

- The first variant is used in an *single execution agent* environment  to set for an agent the starting top-level rule to the given rule specified through the =IdentifierPath=.

- The second variant is used in a *multiple execution agent* environment to set for one or multiple agents the starting top-level rule over a agent relation type specified through =Initializers= which are surrounded by curly brackets.
