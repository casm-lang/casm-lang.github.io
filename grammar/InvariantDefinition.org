* InvariantDefinition

An =invariant= definition allows to globally specify a condition (constrain) which has to be fulfilled during the whole ASM run.
Therefore, the invariant identified by its =Identifier= name gets checked of the current ASM state during all ASM steps. 
If an invariant does violate the defined condition (constrain) an exception is raised.
