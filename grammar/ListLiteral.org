* ListLiteral

The list literal defines a new defined list value.
It can construct an empty list or a list with predefined =Terms=.
The list element type is inferred from the provided =Terms=.
In case of an empty list, the usage of the empty list has to provide a type context to infer the correct inner list element type.
