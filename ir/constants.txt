====== IR Constants ======

Due to the mathematical foundation of ASMs, 
all constants with a type (''T'') can have besides the 
type-specified (domain) content, an undefined value (''undef'').
  Constant ::= "@" identifier "=" Type Value

Furthermore, we directly include in the CASM-IR the notion of symbolic (''sym'')
values that enable a clear definition of numeric as well as symbolic execution,
whereas the symbolic values are its own domain. 
The Listing given below depicts three constant examples --
an integer, a string, and a rule reference constant:

<code>
;; integer constant of value ’123’
@c0 = i 123
;; string constant of value ’foobar’
@c1 = s "foobar"
;; rule reference constant of value ’undef’
@c2 = r < -> v > undef 
</code>
