====== IR Functions ======

One of the most important definition element in CASM-IR are functions. 
They can be specified by using a global symbol and a proper relation [[ir:types|type]] definition. 
Functions are defined with the following Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) grammar:
  Function ::= Global "=" Relation

Listing given below defines a nullary function ''@f'' with relation $f : Integer → Integer$, 
a unary function ''@g'' with relation $g : Integer → String$, and 
a binary function ''@h'' with relation $h : Boolean ∗ Rational → Decimal$.

<code>
@f = < -> i >
@g = < i -> s >
@h = < b , q -> z >
</code>
