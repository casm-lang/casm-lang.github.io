====== Language ======

The CASM language is an Abstract State Machine (ASM) modeling and specification language. 
Its [[syntax]] is influenced in part by [[https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/pm/forschung/projekte/coreasm/|CoreASM]] 
and other ASM languages, but includes language concepts which are included in modern programming languages as well. 
Different to existing implementations is that CASM is a static strong inferred typed ASM language.
