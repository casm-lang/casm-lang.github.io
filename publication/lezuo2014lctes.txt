== Abstract ==
In this paper we present CASM, a language based on Abstract State Machines (ASM), and its optimizing compiler.
ASM is a well-defined (formal) method based on algebraic concepts.
A distinct feature of ASM is its combination of parallel and sequential execution semantics.
This makes it an excellent choice to formally specify and verify micro-architectures.
We present a compilation scheme and an implementation of a runtime system supporting efficient execution of ASM.
After introducing novel analysis techniques we present optimizations allowing us to eliminate many costly operations.
Benchmark results show that our baseline compiler is 2-3 magnitudes faster than other ASM implementations.
The optimizations further increase the performance of the compiled programs up to 264%.
The achieved performance allows our ASM implementation to be used with industry-size applications.
