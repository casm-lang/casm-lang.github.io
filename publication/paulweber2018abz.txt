== Abstract ==
The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known 
formal method, which can be used to specify arbitrary algorithms, 
applications or even whole systems. Over the past years, there have been
many approaches to implement concrete ASM-based modeling and specification 
languages. All of those approaches define their type systems
and operator semantics differently in their internal representation, which
leads to undesired or unexpected behavior during the modeling, the execution, 
and code generation of such ASM specifications. In this paper,
we present CASM-IR, an Intermediate Representation (IR), designed to
aid ASM-based language engineering which is based on a well-formed
ASM-based specification format. Moreover, CASM-IR is conceptualized
from the ground up to ease the formalization of ASM-based analysis and
transformation passes. The feasibility of CASM-IR solving the uniform
ASM representation problem is depicted. Based on our CASM-IR 
implementation, we were able to integrate a front-end of our statically inferred
Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language.
