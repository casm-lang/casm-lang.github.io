== Abstract ==

We present the CASM language, an abstract state machine (ASM) based modeling 
language originally designed for verifying compiler backends. 
We demonstrate the expressiveness by describing an instruction set simulator (ISS) 
for MIPS in approximately 700 lines of code. 
Further we present a refinement of the models to cycle-accurately describe 
two implementations of the classic 5-stage MIPS pipeline. 
Utilizing symbolic execution allows us to prove semantic equivalence of the 
pipeline implementations and the instruction set description. 
Finally we compile the models to C++ and provide a small 
runtime to create a system simulator achieving a performance 
of approx. 1 MHz in MiBench and SPECInt2000 benchmarks.
