== Abstract ==

Abstract. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify 
algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM
languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications
to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a
specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a model-
based transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of 
applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM)
modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different
programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate
model is introduced, which not only captures software-based 
implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in 
the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto
modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for
the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of
our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based 
approach to generate code for different target domains.
